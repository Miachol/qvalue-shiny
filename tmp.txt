File	A vector of p-values (only necessary input). 
&pi;<sub>0</sub> method	Either "smoother" or "bootstrap"; the method for automatically choosing tuning parameter in the estimation of &pi;<sub>0</sub>, the proportion of true null hypotheses.
&lambda; range	The range of the tuning parameter to estimate &pi;<sub>0</sub>. Must be in [0,1). Optional, see Storey (2002).
&lambda; step size	Step size used to determine the number of points between &lambda; range
smooth df	Number of degrees-of-freedom to use when estimating &pi;<sub>0</sub> with a smoother. Optional.
&pi;<sub>0</sub> smoother log	If TRUE and &pi;<sub>0</sub> method = "smoother", &pi;<sub>0</sub> will be estimated by applying a smoother to a scatterplot of log(&pi;<sub>0</sub>) estimates against the tuning parameter &lambda;. Optional.
transformation method	Either a "probit" or "logit" transformation is applied to the p-values so that a local FDR estimate can be formed that does not involve edge effects of the [0,1] interval in which the p-values lie.
truncate local FDR values	If TRUE, local FDR values >1 are set to 1. Default is TRUE.
monotone	If TRUE, local FDR values are non-decreasing with increasing p-values. Default is TRUE; this is recommended.
adjust	Numeric value that is applied as a multiple of the smoothing bandwidth used in the density estimation. Default is adj=1.5. This value is directly assigned to the adjust argument of the density function.
threshold	Numeric value that is threshold for the tails of the empirical p-value distribution. Default is 10<sup>-8</sup>.
FDR level	A level at which to control the FDR. Must be in (0,1]. Optional; if this is selected, a vector of TRUE and FALSE is returned that specifies whether each q-value is less than fdr level or not.
pfdr	An indicator of whether it is desired to make the estimate more robust for small p-values and a direct finite sample estimate of pFDR -- optional.
